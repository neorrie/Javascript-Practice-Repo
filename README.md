# What is this?

This repository is a growing collection of mini JavaScript projects and practice exercises that I’ve completed — and continue to build — as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of JS and improve my problem-solving skills. My goal for each project is to be an opportunity to explore a specific concept/challenge through hands-on practice, to solidify what I learn in theory. After completing each one, I try to take time to reflect on what I’ve learned (through readmes), what could be improved, and how I can apply those lessons moving forward.

The ultimate goal: Keep learning and growing
